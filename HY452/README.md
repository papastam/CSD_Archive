# HY452: Introduction to the Science and Technology of Services *[(website)](https://csd.uoc.gr/~hy452/)*

CS-452 offers an introduction to the science and technology of services. The services sector plays a major role in modern economies. In Greece in particular, services form the backbone of economic activity. The emergence of information and communication technologies (ICT) motivated the advent of electronic services (e-services), expected to continue growing at a fast pace in the years to come. The science of services conceptualizes the design of service systems, analyzes their operation, and predicts their evolution. Technologies underlying services are supporting the design, monitoring, analysis, and implementation of complex service systems comprising machines (software and hardware) and people. The explosive growth of e-services has also fueled the need for designing, implementing, and managing large-scale infrastructures to support service systems. An objective of this course is to offer an introduction to scalable infrastructure technologies and to the cloud computing platforms and systems that typically support the operation of large-scale e-services.

The CS-452 curriculum covers: 

- Introduction to the use of data and knowledge in the Internet for the smart composition of new services; introduction to workflows and business processes; introduction to the economy of services and the connection of financial and enterprise goals with networks (systems) of services and business processes (6 weeks)
    - XML Basics, XPath, XML Schema Languages, XSLT
    - Introduction to the Semantic Web, introduction to OWL and OWL-S
    - Introduction to workflow models and specifications, in relation to the full set of WS* specifications
    - Introduction to the modeling, analysis, design and development of business processes
    - Learning of the use of tools and frameworks for modeling and designing business processes: WBI Modeler, BPMN tools, Adonis, κλπ. (1st problem set)
    - Supply and Demand curves, utility functions, theories of value of service systems and ways to compute it, elements of mathematical programming and optimization and their use in economic analysis of service systems
    - Modeling and economic analysis of service systems, correlation with business processes, WS* specifications, Rosetta Net, eBXML
    - Production of skeleton code for workflows via appropriate tools (π.χ. e.g. Studio Developer) (2nd problem set)
 

- Introduction to infrastructure technologies for large-scale e-service systems and implementation of new services on cloud computing platforms (6 weeks):
    - Introduction to techniques for implementing large-scale e-services, with emphasis on performance, high availability, reliability, and manageability
    - Techniques for achieving high performance in scalable e-services
    - Techniques for achieving high availability and reliability in scalable e-services
    - Techniques for improving the manageability of scalable e-services
    - Cloud computing platforms and services
    - Large-scale services based on Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies (smart cities, transportation, energy, etc.)
    - Μanaging quality-of-service (QoS) based on service-level agreements
    - Μanaging the human factor in providing large-scale e-services (3rd problem set)

There will be a collective project assignment at the end of the semester.
