# HY359: Web Programming *[(website)](https://csd.uoc.gr/~hy359/)*

Web Programming deals with application development at the higher level of the TCP/IP protocol (application layer). The main difference between Web applications compared to other kinds of applications is that the Web is used the underlying platform which in turn has several consequences, i.e. all input and output operations should be supported through the capabilities offered by Web Browsers, while the business logic of the system should be encapsulated for being operational through Web servers and the HTTP protocol which is a stateless protocol. This course is an introduction to the technologies necessary for the development of Web applications. At first the course focuses on client-side technologies (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript), then on server side technologies (Servlets, JSP and others) and finally the course contains an introduction to XML technologies (XML, XML Schema, XPath, XSLT). Apart from the final written exam, students have to carry out programmatic exercises and a project whose objective is to design and develop a complex web application.
